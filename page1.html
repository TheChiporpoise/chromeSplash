            For any equilateral polygon, an additional amount of polygons (1 less than the amount of points/sides it has) can be created through 
            iterating each combination of the x y coordinates of the points of the original polygon. This can be seen in the image to the left, 
            where the original polygon is an equilateral triangle and lines representing the x and y values are graphed, intersecting with each 
            point of each plotted triangle, or viewed in this 
            <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6iedciuaax" target="_blank">desmos</a>. 
            When the original polygon is rotated, the additional polygons are set in motion as well, and appear to rotate in separate three 
            dimensional planes. For its simplicity, this effect appears quite complex at a glance, which makes this quite appealing from a 
            programming standpoint. This is due in part to a seemingly complex result arising from an easily iterable and relatively 
            non-computationally intensive process, or in other words, easy work cool result.

            The colors for the background drawings are generated using a conditional statement that iterates through values from 0 to 255 by 
            increments of 5 for the 
            <span style="color: red">r</span>, 
            <span style="color: green">g</span>, and 
            <span style="color: blue">b</span> values respectively. The maximum sum of the 
            <span style="color: red">r</span>, 
            <span style="color: green">g</span>, and 
            <span style="color: blue">b</span> 
            is 510, peaking only when 2 of the 
            aforementioned variables are both 255. Out of necessity, the conditions also force at least one of the 
            <span style="color: red">r</span>, 
            <span style="color: green">g</span>, and 
            <span style="color: blue">b</span> 
            values to be 
            zeroed out until another value zeroes out. This creates a circular flow in the values, allowing the full color wheel to be 
            covered. This ultimately yields another layer to how visually appealing the drawing is, or in other words, adds to how cool this 
            looks.
